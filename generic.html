              HTML: HTML or HyperText Markup Language represents the building
              blocks of the web. The role HTML plays in a webpage is to
              strucutre the text in an understandable way and to group elements
              by tags to represent different sections containers or text. Some
              examples of tags that organize pages can be the header tag at the
              top, section tags in between, and the footer tag at the bottom.
              There is a wide array of HTML elements to represent different
              things. Text for example can be in the form of an H1-H6 tag which
              is for larger header text. A p tag can be utilized to represent
              paragraph text. In a nutshell HTML creates the structure of the
              text within a webpage and is the building block of a website.

              helping making elements functional in a webpage, as well as on the
              backend sometimes managing things. The overall role js serves is
              to help users interact with parts of a webpage and to implement
              more complex utilities that cannot be achieve with mere CSS or
              HTML. JS can be used for example when a user clicks a button to
              open a popup. Javascript is what powers the web to make things
              interactable and is a very important tool for any frontend
              developer to know. By implenting js you can make websites very
              intuitive for users, and help manage data on the website.

              presses a key, or clicks a button. It can be used to validate
              things like forms and check for errors. It is a full fleged
              programming language, so it has many many features. You can
              request data from the backend using javascript and show it on a
              webpage. From managing the interaction of the webpage to providing
              data to a webpage it serves many purposes.
